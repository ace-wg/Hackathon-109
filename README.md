# Hackathon-109

The following ACE related projects are in the planning for the Hackathon week prior to IETF 109.

The exact dates/times will be added to this document as they are selected.

## OSCORE Group Communication

Testing of draft-ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm to do key derivation for contexts and send messages between different entities.

The intention is to mostly do unicast testing for client-server but if the VPN works well we might try multicast testing as well.

## Group KDC interactions

Testing of draft-ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore , especially the exchange of Joining Request and Joining Reponse between a joining node and a Group Manager.
